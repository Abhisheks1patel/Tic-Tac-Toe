#Tic-Tac-Toe


####  Overview
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Java and Java Swing. The game allows two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid, and the first player to get three of their marks in a row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

##########   Features
Graphical User Interface (GUI): The game has a user-friendly GUI built with Java Swing, providing a visually appealing and interactive experience.

Two-Player Mode: Play against a friend, taking turns to make moves on the board.

Win Detection: The game checks for a winning condition after each move to determine if a player has won.

Reset and Exit: Option to reset the game and start over, as well as an option to exit the application.
